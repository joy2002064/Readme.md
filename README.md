# House Price Prediction By Joy Bormon

## Overview
This project is a **House Price Prediction** application built with **Python** and features an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. It uses **Polynomial Regression** to predict house prices based on user-provided data. The application supports dataset uploads, training the model, visualizing results, and exporting predictions.

All prices are displayed in **Bangla Taka (à§³)**.

## Features
- **Upload Dataset**: Load a `.csv` file containing house data.
- **Train Model**: Train a **Polynomial Regression** model with a customizable degree.
- **Predict Prices**: Enter a feature (e.g., area in sqft) to get a price prediction.
- **Visualization**: View the scatter plot of data and the fitted curve.
- **Export Results**: Save predictions alongside the dataset into a `.csv` file.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - tkinter (default in Python)

Install required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
